"Too many ads, way too one sided. Everything is a sales funnel"
No
It’s not as useful as the other platforms.
It has gotten more boring and dully repetitive over the years.

Time killing Apps #1
snapchat is so creepy to me idk
N/A
Instagram is becoming the new Snapchat. I only use it for filters
I don’t use it
Before it was better now i dont like it too much. I just use it to take funny pics with my friends and my cat.
Instagram does everything so I stopped using snap a few years ago
"yes, snapchat kinda gay"
Na

"General Horrible app, to many ads, gives out your location. Its crappy in general, got rid of it."
Nah. Good luck on your project fam
"No, I tend to use it for one friend to contact or for streaks"
Nope.
Have no idea how to use it
"I hate how when you click on something, something else comes up. It’s not really easy to use for me, I feel like it’s not organized well"
No.
I don’t want to see stories from people I don’t even have on my friends list (ex. Celebrities)
it's shit
n/a
"Snapchat Discover is full of ads and corporate propaganda, I never watch anything on Snapchat Discover for that reason"
I don’t really like it I just use it for family usage
Only downloaded SC for my daughter.
I don’t think anyone actively uses Snapchat anymore. It’s very outdated.
mainly use it to send pics and vids to girlfriend. i text all my other friends
I don’t have time in my day to try to catch someone’s post before it disappears. Seems very demanding.
"Never used it, never downloaded it, don’t know what it is."
I don't know what it is.
"It was fun when I first got it back in 2013, but the excitement died out for me once my friends and I stoppped using it as much."
NO
It seems critical for single people these days. As a married person I find it uninteresting. None of my friends use Snapchat anymore either.
"I used it a bit as a teen in high school, never used it since"
Besides YouTube I dislike the rest
It’s not as simple as it used to be :(
Nope! sorry I couldn't be more help. I just don't do social media.
sometimes their videos won't send to a certain person
Haven’t used Snapchat
sucks on android
It’s a unique form of social media.
I use it mainly for daily streaks
The camera filters and geotags are big for snap
I need to know why are you taking this survey and is focused mainly on Snapchat?
I use Snapchat to see the news
I only use it so much because of streaks
"It was once a great communication tool that has been turned into what KiK evolved to (in terms of relationship and unsolicited photographs). Their attempt to bring creative content onto the platform, which in turn led to more ads, was another factor that possibly led to their downfall."
its more teen or geared towards young adults
snapchat is for gen z
Only use for streaks
Drinks your battery up and it’s easy to accidentally do something on Snapchat
the filters make me feel less insecure lol
"I don't use snapchat so I don't know. I hear that it is like a game and that there are points for streaks. This is designed to make it addictive. I generally limit all social media I use, that is Facebook, Instagram, Discord and Reddit to very limited amounts of time each day to stay productive."
Daily maiil can just fuck off
I haven’t tried it but I might. I am already on a lot of sites
I used it a lot more back in college (2012ish).
